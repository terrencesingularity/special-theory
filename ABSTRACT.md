Abstract

The Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus proposes that nuclear weapons are no longer adequately understood as discrete devices, arsenals, or decision points, but instead function as a single, distributed, emergent system operating across states, technologies, doctrines, and time. This system—the nuclear weapons corpus—exhibits properties that cannot be reduced to the behavior or control of any individual weapon or actor.

The theory formalizes the claim that what is commonly described as “nuclear war” is not a future event but an ongoing structural condition, characterized by automation, compression of decision time, interdependence, and irreversible coupling between political, technical, and strategic subsystems. Within this condition, traditional notions of control, deterrence, and expertise become increasingly misaligned with the actual behavior of the system as a whole.

The Special Theory specifies the conditions under which nuclear weapons behave as a singular system, defines its boundary conditions, and distinguishes structural properties of the nuclear weapons corpus from contingent political or historical factors. The aim of the theory is not to offer policy prescriptions, but to make explicit the structural reality of the nuclear condition, thereby enabling clearer reasoning about risk, agency, and responsibility in the nuclear era.
