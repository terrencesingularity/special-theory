Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus

(Nuclear Singularity Theory)

This repository contains the first edition statement of the Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus (“Nuclear Singularity Theory”).

The Special Theory advances a single core claim:

What is commonly imagined as “nuclear war” is better understood as an ongoing structural condition.
Nuclear weapons now function as a single, distributed, emergent system — a nuclear weapons corpus — rather than as discrete, independently controlled weapons.

The theory formalizes this claim and specifies the conditions under which it holds.

Contents

This repository contains three essays that together constitute the first edition statement of the Special Theory:

Essay I — Definition of the Nuclear Weapons Corpus

Essay II — Formal Structure and Relations (including equations and definitions)

Essay III — Boundary Conditions, Implications, and Limits of Applicability

These texts are intended to be read together. No drafts, notes, or experimental materials are included here.

Status

This repository presents the Special Theory as a complete theoretical statement in its first edition.

The theory has not yet undergone formal peer review or external evaluation.
Its presentation here is intended to make the structure of the theory explicit and available for examination, critique, and comparison.

Relation to Ongoing Work

Further work — including applications, extensions, explanatory writing, cultural and epistemological implications, and the development of a General Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus — is being carried out in a separate repository:

[link to General Theory / continuing work repo]

That repository is the appropriate place for ongoing development and interpretation.

Explanatory Book

An explanatory book, Singularity of Nuclear Weapons Corpus, is being written to make the Special Theory legible to a general audience by walking through the theory point by point and equation by equation.
