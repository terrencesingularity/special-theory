# Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus (Nuclear Singularity Theory)

This repository contains working drafts, notes, and reference materials for the **Special Theory of Nuclear Weapons Corpus** (“Nuclear Singularity Theory”).

Core claim (in brief): what is commonly imagined as “nuclear war” is better understood as an ongoing structural condition, and the nuclear system functions as a single emergent corpus rather than a set of discrete, independently controlled weapons.

## Contents
- Draft essays / chapters

- Diagrams and outlines
- Sources and quotations (with citations where available)

## Status
